# What can you do to learn Convergent Facilitation?

If you want to learn Convergent Facilitation, either to eventually become a facilitator yourself or to just bring more integration into your daily life, we recommend starting with either or both of these:

----

## Read the Book 

The Highest Common Denominator provides readers with the tools to learn and implement Convergent Facilitation. The book moves through three phases of a process that brings groups to outcomes that are profoundly collaborative and genuinely supported by all. Through vivid case studies and practical examples, the book explains:

- How to guide people towards solutions that integrate everyone’s needs and concerns without requiring compromise
- How to keep people on track with the task at hand
- How to invite dissent and engage with it productively
- How to attend to the power differences that so often interfere with collaboration
