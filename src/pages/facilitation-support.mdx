# Facilitation Support

:construction: :seedling: **WORK IN PROGRESS**  :seedling: :construction:

- we have at present a very limited number of highly experienced and endorsed convergent facilitation facilitators
- convergent facilitation is a highly skillful approach and takes time to learn. We want to use every opportunity to build more capacity within the CF community, and a expand the pool of endorsed CF facilitators. Therefore:
    - for every project that we support, there will be 1-2 CF apprentices joining the experienced facilitator during the process
    - for every project that we take on, we want to record sessions (if they happen online) and make them available to an extended group of CF practitioners and apprentices for learning
    - part of the money engaged in the facilitation process will flow to the CF community and support the financial sustainability of people engaged in its stewarding
 - these agreements could be modified for projects that have super sensitive information and are important enough for us to support

Criteria regarding decision making processes we want to support:
- multistakeholders and within a highly polarised field
- directling impacting the wellbeing of empoverished communities and ecosystems' regeneration
- has the potential to model new ways of making decisions in fields that have traditionally relied heavily on top down decision making
- 

If your process you would like support for matches these criteria, please email us with a brief outline of what the decision is about and who the stakeholders are
